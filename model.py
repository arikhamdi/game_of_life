"""
Conwayâ€™s Game of life
The Rules

BIRTH: a new cell is born if it is surrounded by exactly three live cells.
LIFE: a cell lives on as long as it is surrounded by two or three live cells.
DEATH: a cell dies of loneliness if it is surrounded by fewer than two live cells.
A cell dies of overcrowding if it is surrounding by four or more live cells.
